# ABSTRACT: Steven's shortcut modules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution contains shortcut names for various modules that I often use,
mostly for one-liners. It does not reside on CPAN, for obvious reason. Instead,
I put it on my personal DarkPAN. You can install it with:

 % cpanm --mirror https://github.com/sharyanto/darkpan-steven/raw/master/ --mirror-only SHARYANTO::Shortcuts
